# NCurated

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/ryanhs/node-curated.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/ryanhs/node-curated)

This is not a Framework per se. This more like just a curated list of nodejs packages.

Example, in building microservices usually we face the situation that we know we need stream feature.
Either its kafka, redis, or, nats, or something else. Thats we start to have a migraine \-\_\-.

This curated list i made, is try to put abstraction on top of these libraries.

## Integration

This curated list is not really binding into a Framework.
Please feel free to use any framework to use. \*as long as its compatible :-)

## Utilities

### Log

### Metrics

## Requirements

Although some of the packages, it can be running at least node 8.11. Its recommended to run it in current supported LTS version. (dubnium parhaps?).
